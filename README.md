# Pong
Play the game, Pong, against a computer controlled player!  Scores are recorded in the top corner until a winner has been decided.  The background screen will tint with the color of the corresponding player who is currently in the lead.

The computer will seek to chase down the ball when the ball is coming toward the computer goal.  The computer has a random chance to pursue the ball or remain idle at any given moment; this was implemented to allow for a difficulty option when playing against the computer.  After the computer defends its goal, it will return to the middle position.
